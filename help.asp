<a name="Subscribe"></a><h3>Subscriber Access Difficulties</h3>

<ol>
<li>If when attempting to register for the first time you are taken to the
"How to Subscribe" page instead of "Member Information" or "Subscriber
Information" page:</li>

  <ul>
  <li>You may be using a different e-mail address than the one entered into our
  database (e-mail addresses must be exact or the database will not recognize
  the user.)</li>

    <ol>
    <li>Contact Customer Service (e-mail:
    <a href="mailto:CustomerService@JuneWarren-Nickles.com">CustomerService@JuneWarren-Nickles.com)
    </a></li>
    </ol>
  </ul>

<li>You have viewed the Rig Locator online before but now you are asked to
enter your e-mail address and password:</li>

  <ul>
  <li>It would seem that one of two things has happened:</li>

    <ol>
    <li>The cookies in your browser have been deleted. Your password is
    saved in a <a href="#Cookies">cookie</A> text file. This is to allow you
    to access the Rig Locator without having to enter your password each
    time. Often cookies are stored in temporary files and sometimes
    inadvertently they are deleted. If this is the case you will need to
    <a href="#password">request a new password</a>.</li>

    <li>You are trying to access the Rig Locator from another browser,
    workstation or remote location. Since the password is saved in a cookie
    only the browser that you initially registered on can be used without
    needing to <a href="#password">request a new password</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h3><a name="Password"></a>Request a New Password</h3>

<ol>
<li>Go to the Rig Locator home page at
<a href="/">www.riglocator.ca</a></li>
<li>Click on "Contractors' Summary"</li>
<li>On the page where it says &quot;This is a paid subscription site&quot;
insert your e-mail address and click &lt;OK&gt;.
<li>At the bottom of the page where it says &quot;Email my password to me&quot;
select this link</li>
<li>Click on &lt;Email My Password&gt; button</li>
<li>When you receive your new password it is best to copy and paste it into the
password field on the User Login page as sometimes typos are made. This happens
because, when viewed with a serif font, such as Times New Romans, numbers can
look like letters and visa versa (e.g., the number &quot;1&quot; and the letter
&quot;l&quot;.)</li>

<h3><a name="Search"></a>Search Features</h3>

  On the Rig Locator home page:
    <ol type="a">

    <li>Choose one of the Search options buttons</li>
      <ol>
      <li>By Date</li>
      <li>By Operator (the default)</li>
      <li>By Location</li>
      </ol>
    <li>When searching "By Operator" or "By Location":</li>
      <ol>
      <li>Select the appropriate criteria from the drop-down list(s)</li>
      <li>Click on the "Search" button</li>
      </ol>

  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Note:<br>
When searching "By Operator" typing the first letter of the operator's name in
the "Operator" field will bring you to all operators starting with that letter.
Then scroll down until you locate the operator you want to search for. (This
also works in the "Projected Zone", year, month and date fields.)</p>
