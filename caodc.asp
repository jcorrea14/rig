  Important information about the CAODC's rig utilization data and Rig
  Locator's rig activity data
</h1>

<h2>
  CAODC rig utilization data
</h2>

<p>
  The Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC)
  became the sole collector and source of drilling rig utilization
  data, starting in September 2013.
</p>

<p>
  The CAODC data indicates whether rigs are drilling, which the
  association defines as spud to rig release, or down. The CAODC uses
  this definition to calculate its weekly rig count and the utilization
  rate of the drilling fleet.
</p>

<p>
  For any questions about CAODC data, please contact
  Kate Jackson at 403-264-4311 ext 108.
</p>

<h2>
  Rig Locator rig activity data
</h2>

<p>
  The Rig Locator website provides information on rig activity in Canada.
</p>

<p>
  Rig activity differs from rig utilization data as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Active rigs on the Rig Locator website are defined as rigs that
    are drilling, rigging up or moving. (Note: MIR status means the
    rig is moving. There is no guarantee that the rig is moving in or
    out of the location reported.)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Information on drilling rig activity found on the Rig Locator
  website is derived from multiple sources, including: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a data file received from the CAODC</li>
  <li>government data, such as spud and board reports; and</li>
  <li>private third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The Rig Locator website provides additional value to the rig
  activity data by attaching well information, such as: projected
  depth, well objective, area name, well class, well type, PSAC area
  and UWI. 
</p>

<p>
  For any questions about Rig Locator data, please contact
  Tammy Cosens (403) 209-3529.
</p>

<P>
  Note: JuneWarren-Nickle's Energy Group does not warrant or guarantee
  the information contained on its Rig Locator website as it is
  obtained from outside sources.
